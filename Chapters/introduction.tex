\section{Named Data Networking}

Today's Internet's hourglass architecture centers on a
universal network layer (i.e., IP) which implements the minimal functionality  necessary  for  global interconnectivity. This thin  waist  enabled  the Internet's  explosive  growth  by  allowing both lower and upper layer technologies to innovate independently.  However, IP was designed to create a communication  network
, where  packets  named  only  communication endpoints.  Sustained growth in e-commerce, digital media, social networking, and smartphone applications has led to dominant use of the Internet as a distribution network.

Distribution networks are more general than communication
networks, and solving distribution problems via a point to point communication protocol is complex and error-prone.
Named Data Networking (NDN) project proposed an
evolution of the IP architecture that generalizes the role of this  thin  waist,  such  that  packets  can  name  objects  rather than  communication  endpoint.

\section{PIRL}

My internship has been held in CICSO Company and i had a great pleasure to be under direction of Cisco Principle Engineer Luca MUSCARIELLO  for this period of 6 months. PIRL is acrynom for \textbf{P}aris \textbf{I}nnovation and \textbf{R}esearch \textbf{L}ab which is located in Issy les moulineaux region, near to Paris (\ref{cisco}). Leader of ICN in PIRL is Giovanna CAROFIGLIO. Alain FIOCCO is the  Director CTO of PIRL.

\section{Tools of Internship}

I used a machine with an operating system of the latest distribution of Linux Ubuntu 16.04, lenovo ThinkPad Laptop serie T450 of CORE i5 with 2 cores. Our expermimental tests are totally done on powerful cisco's server (pirl-ndn-2.com) with 48 cores and 252 GB memory RAM. We have used \textit{ifstat} of linux implementation to see the rates output of result and \textit{ndn-icp-download} application to downloading in MultiThreading processing on different containers at the same time. Latest version of Python (3.5) was used to compile the program.

\textbf{\Huge{Lurch}} is an orchestrator for large scale and highly reconfigurable NDN experimental test-beds written in python for any platform, i.e., large Grids, local lab, providing connectivity among servers involved in the test-bed, ... .

Basically Python language is perfectly designed to develop new algorithms becasue of it's very usefull functionalities and handfull algorithm sense, I mean you can write a 10 lines of C code in just one line in python! Albeit according to \cite{python} we note that Python implementations may be not as fast as C/C++ counterparts but they scale with the input size according to the theory which claims a good reason to choose \textit{Python} anyway as the core part of Lurch.

Actually this emulator emulates linux containers which are like virtual machines in function of your setup. I said like, becasue there is difference between VMs and containers and the difference is the overhead that comes with running a separate kernel and simulating all the hardware when we have VMs. These containers are produced by ubuntu image server installed on the server then \textit{Lurch} clone this image to different machines to have virtual network machines. 

This tool can be used for researchers to test their customized network on the real virtual machines and run some usefull experiments. This means you can have your own OpenFlow who enables network controller to determine the path of network packets across a network of switches or virtual ethernet interfaces (MACVLAN interfaces).

Lurch produces some Modules in which you can setup your network: \textit{NDNmanager}, \textit{MobilityManager}, \textit{Topology}, \textit{Clustermanager}. We added a new Module Called \textit{RoutingNDN} in which you will find different algorithms to choose and some functionalities for modifying the Graph of network.
We also added some new functionalities on \textit{CommandLineInterface}, \textit{NetworkManager}, \textit{ConfigReader} and \textit{NDNmanager} module to have the ability to change the network parameters like capacity, delay, forwarding plane instantly which was very important in our testing experiments.

Figure \ref{cli} shows configuration, setup step of Lurch.
'../Network' is the address of input configuration files like Topology, position of Clients and Producers and the content that they search, mobility model of network a setting file about URL server, layer2 protocols, information about mobility parameteres, ... . By this way you can make your clusters on server.

$m942$ is ExperimentID of the user who runs his expermiment on this server. We use SSH remote login service to enter to each containers.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{Pictures/lurch.png}

\caption{Command Line Interface} \label{cli} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}

 
Figure \ref{table} is the table of linux containers running on the server \textit{pirl-ndn-2.com}. You can see the IPv4 virtual interfaces on each container and the name NodeID for each interfaces which have the same as NodeID of end link. On Container \textit{m942michel} you see a \textit{wlan0} interface becasue this node is choosen Access Point node in setup level. This interface is now eumulated by ndnSIM using lxc-wifi-tap script. In figure \ref{data} you can see an example of how we can get our output in Kbps for each link.


\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.3]{Pictures/table.png}

\caption{Table of Emulated Linux Containers on pirl-ndn-2.com} \label{table} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}


 
\textit{setup environment} will setup completely your containers on the server with all of information needed to have a virtual network. As figure \ref{cli} shows step by step setups which are successful which is not quiet short! \textit{Routing scripts created} is where the routing scritps are creating in each different containers then you have \textit{NDN routing set} step when you push your scripts on containers. normally this stage takes more time than the previous step. Each routing scripts includes bash commands to run which are coming from NFD command line interfaces (Picture \ref{script}). By \textit{create} and  command you can create a new face and \textit{register} you can add the routes in the RIB.   
 
\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{Pictures/data.png}

\caption{Rates Trace using ifstat} \label{data} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}
 
 
 
Next step to continue is doing \textit{start repo} command line which creates a dameon of \textit{repo-ng} application on all producer nodes NFD using a timer which waits for state of process intelligently. Figure \ref{repo} shows this step in Lurch. As you can see it declares you on which node the repository is created and how many repositories exist on the network.



\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{Pictures/script.png}

\caption{NDN Routing Script} \label{script} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{Pictures/start_repo.png}

\caption{Starting Repository Daemon} \label{repo} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}




In figure \ref{download} you can see by \textit{list client} and \textit{list repo} command line which lists the clients and producers on your network. Then as we have started repositories engine, now it's time to choose the routing algorithm. It's easy, you just write route set, then TAB to see the different algorithms which will appear on your terminal, then you can select one of them and click ENTER.

Now it's time to run your experiment, this is doing just by \textit{start} command line you can see 2 downloading thread is started at the same time becasue you had 2 clients searching same content.  

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{Pictures/download.png}

\caption{Downloading Step} \label{download} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}


In figure \ref{capacity} by \textit{link show} command you can see all of link capacities. by \textit{link edit shahab jordan 20000} you can change link capacity between 'shahab' and 'luca' container.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.55]{Pictures/capacity.png}

\caption{Link Capacity Modification} \label{capacity} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}
 
We have implemented also implemented an algorithm to full automatization the routing, it means that in function of network situation you can adapt proper algorithm to your routing updates, which depend on workload system can be varried and played. This can be very usefull when we want to have demonstrations on our work.

Picture \ref{auto} shows well when we do \textit{route auto} TreeOnConsumer algorithm is chosen becasue of the structure of workload. It means that in workload you have one producer and 2 consumers who are searching the content. So this algorithm is just a brain who understands and can adapt algorithms to proper station of system.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{Pictures/auto.png}

\caption{Automatization algorithm} \label{auto} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}


In figure \ref{lxc} you can see the difference between linux containers and virtual machines which is very important. Actually linux containers use \textit{cgroups} kernel module to get prior for each machine on the same host server.

This appearance makes linux containers to be very successful becasue of ability to manage and control the guests machines becasue basically they share one kernel on machine.

\section{Scope and Objectives}
In These days, 2016,  there is a lot of research and new ideas on 5G cellular networks on different aspects of Research and Development from advanced chip designing techniques and hardware, antenna designing to whole different network architectures, algorithms, computations even some ideas to combine it with Quad drones robots and ... for the 2020 plan. It's a bit like the evolution from 1999 to 2000 for IT and computer science domain.

ICN has a fundamental designing philosophy in which you will be able to have like a PeerToPeer (Figure \ref{peertopeer}) or IoT way of thinking in which each node will be a peer who can talk with his neighbours using P2P protocol on second layer of ICN model where he is searching chunk of your data as it's clear on the waist ICN Model (Figure \ref{spec}). 


\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Pictures/peertopeer.png}

\caption{PeerToPeer Network} \label{peertopeer} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}



Information Centric Networking layer model shows a bit names in ICN can be like a replacement in TCP/IP architecure in this sense you can imagine that all nodes have the same responsibility to pipline packets to the network and you can have Device 2 Device (D2D) communication in which instead of putting clock at a special time alarm in each night, Or at the evening, light and heat of Sunshine (with embedded Sensor installed on window) can capture temperature of heatness then talk to your Table-Lamp installed beside your bedroom and turn it on and your alarm clock to ring and waking you up or immediately turn your microwave on to heat bread inside (\ref{internetofthings})



\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{Pictures/spec.png}

\caption{ICN vs TCP/IP OSI model} \label{spec} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{Pictures/internetofthings.png}

\caption{Smart Room in IoT} \label{internetofthings} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{2020} estimation calculated shows more than 25 Billion things will be connected in 2020! \textit{Smart Cities} is another word that we hear everywhere in Technology domain in these days. So it sounds there exists a strong merging between communicaiton world and computer/artificial intelligence or robotics. This merging needs a better solution for communicating between machines/robots. We believe that ICN is a good architecture to solve this essential problem. It seems also more and more calling communication system philosophy is \textit{expired}! or if it is not today it will be expired in near future. ICN as Jacobson et al explained in \cite{jacobson} has more intelligent and logic architecture.


\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{center}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.31]{Pictures/2020.jpg}

\caption{Plan 2020} \label{2020} 

\end{center}

\end{figure}


 We beleive ICN architecture can be a very suitable fit for 5G networks becasue of its advantage against TCP/IP architecture, and important network functionalities like congestion control, storage data, security, and mobility protocols which can be a good idea specially in case of wireless mobile communication in which nodes can be moved with every speed and channel conditions in the case that all of objects are connected together and they talk together with ICN protocol specification.

So if you are in Cisco Systems Paris and you search \textit{'movie.mp4'} on YouTube maybe on the network one of your neighbours has been downloaded once. So now instead of talking with YouTube's server in USA you can take it from one of your near nodes beside Issy val de seine train station and not making more extra traffic on network.


In this way Cisco has been investigated ICN in context of 5G and notably for popular applications like video delivery, which is one of the most popular applications in these days, people want to see a video on YouTube, Netflix, ... everywhere and everytime in the metro stations, in the building, in the bitches with different Transcoder of video coding and with the highest speed of downloading which network should produce them.

\textit{Four Routing} algorithms (Strategies) are added to \textit{Lurch} to use in different conditions of Network. \textit{Auto} strategy also is added which is as an algorithm that chooses the proper strategy in function of network condition and in demand of clients. This strategy is added on \textit{NetworkManager} Module.

%\section{Physical Layer}
%In this chapter , at first, we are going to explain about the kinds of channels which is used in DASH7 Protocl which in that we are showing the power spectral density for different channels and our Masks definition. 
%If you are familiar with \LaTeX{}, then you can familiarise yourself with the contents of the Zip file and the directory structure and then place your own information into the `\texttt{Thesis.cls}' file. Section \ref{FillingFile} on page \pageref{FillingFile} tells you how to do this. Make sure you read section \ref{ThesisConventions} about thesis conventions to get the most out of this template and then get started with the `\texttt{Thesis.tex}' file straightaway.
%
%If you are new to \LaTeX{} it is recommended that you carry on reading through the rest of the information in this document.
%
%\subsection{Spectrum Utilization and Channels}
%
%This \LaTeX{} Thesis Template is originally based and created around a \LaTeX{} style file created by Steve R.\ Gunn from the University of Southampton (UK), department of Electronics and Computer Science. You can find his original thesis style file at his site, here:\\
%\href{http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~srg/softwaretools/document/templates/}{\texttt{http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/$\sim$srg/softwaretools/document/templates/}}
%
%My thesis originally used the `\texttt{ecsthesis.cls}' from his list of styles. However, I knew \LaTeX{} could still format better. To get the look I wanted, I modified his style and also created a skeleton framework and folder structure to place the thesis files in.
%
%This Thesis Template consists of that modified style, the framework and the folder structure. All the work that has gone into the preparation and groundwork means that all you have to bother about is the writing.
%Before you begin using this template you should ensure that its style complies with the thesis style guidelines imposed by your institution. In most cases this template style and layout will be suitable. If it is not, it may only require a small change to bring the template in line with your institution's recommendations.
%
%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%\section{What this Template Includes}
%
%\subsection{Folders}
%
%This template comes as a single Zip file that expands out to many files and folders. The folder names are mostly self-explanatory:
%
%\textbf{Appendices} -- this is the folder where you put the appendices. Each appendix should go into its own separate `\texttt{.tex}' file. A template is included in the directory.
%
%\textbf{Chapters} -- this is the folder where you put the thesis chapters. A thesis usually has about seven chapters, though there is no hard rule on this. Each chapter should go in its own separate `\texttt{.tex}' file and they usually are split as:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Chapter 1: Introduction to the thesis topic
%\item Chapter 2: Background information and theory
%\item Chapter 3: (Laboratory) experimental setup
%\item Chapter 4: Details of experiment 1
%\item Chapter 5: Details of experiment 2
%\item Chapter 6: Discussion of the experimental results
%\item Chapter 7: Conclusion and future directions
%\end{itemize}
%This chapter layout is specialised for the experimental sciences.
%
%\textbf{Figures} -- this folder contains all figures for the thesis. These are the final images that will go into the thesis document.
%
%\textbf{Primitives} -- this is the folder that contains scraps, particularly because one final image in the `Figures' folder may be made from many separate images and photos, these source images go here. This keeps the intermediate files separate from the final thesis figures.
%
%\subsection{Files}
%
%Included are also several files, most of them are plain text and you can see their contents in a text editor. Luckily, many of them are auxiliary files created by \LaTeX{} or BibTeX and which you don't need to bother about:
%
%\textbf{Bibliography.bib} -- this is an important file that contains all the bibliographic information and references that you will be citing in the thesis for use with BibTeX. You can write it manually, but there are reference manager programs available that will create and manage it for you. Bibliographies in \LaTeX{} are a large subject and you may need to read about BibTeX before starting with this.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.cls} -- this is an important file. It is the style file that tells \LaTeX{} how to format the thesis. You will also need to open this file in a text editor and fill in your own information (such as name, department, institution). Luckily, this is not too difficult and is explained in section \ref{FillingFile} on page \pageref{FillingFile}.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.pdf} -- this is your beautifully typeset thesis (in the PDF file format) created by \LaTeX{}.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.tex} -- this is an important file. This is the file that you tell \LaTeX{} to compile to produce your thesis as a PDF file. It contains the framework and constructs that tell \LaTeX{} how to layout the thesis. It is heavily commented so you can read exactly what each line of code does and why it is there. After you put your own information into the `\texttt{Thesis.cls}' file, go to this file and begin filling it in -- you have now started your thesis!
%
%\textbf{vector.sty} -- this is a \LaTeX{} package, it tells \LaTeX{} how to typeset mathematical vectors. Using this package is very easy and you can read the documentation on the site (you just need to look at the `\texttt{vector.pdf}' file):\\
%\href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/vector/}{\texttt{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/vector/}}
%
%\textbf{lstpatch.sty} -- this is a \LaTeX{} package required by this LaTeX template and is included as not all \TeX{} distributions have it installed by default. You do not need to modify this file.
%
%Files that are \emph{not} included, but are created by \LaTeX{} as auxiliary files include:
%
%\textbf{Thesis.aux} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main `\texttt{.tex}' file.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.bbl} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by BibTeX, if it is deleted, BibTeX simply regenerates it when you run the main tex file. Whereas the `\texttt{.bib}' file contains all the references you have, this `\texttt{.bbl}' file contains the references you have actually cited in the thesis and is used to build the bibliography section of the thesis.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.blg} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by BibTeX, if it is deleted BibTeX simply regenerates it when you run the main `\texttt{.tex}' file.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.lof} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main `\texttt{.tex}' file. It tells \LaTeX{} how to build the `List of Figures' section.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.log} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main `\texttt{.tex}' file. It contains messages from \LaTeX{}, if you receive errors and warnings from \LaTeX{}, they will be in this `\texttt{.log}' file.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.lot} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main `\texttt{.tex}' file. It tells \LaTeX{} how to build the `List of Tables' section.
%
%\textbf{Thesis.out} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main `\texttt{.tex}' file.
%
%
%So from this long list, only the files with the `\texttt{.sty}', `\texttt{.bib}', `\texttt{.cls}' and `\texttt{.tex}' extensions are the most important ones. The other auxiliary files can be ignored or deleted as \LaTeX{} and BibTeX will regenerate them.
%
%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%\section{Filling in the `\texttt{Thesis.cls}' File}\label{FillingFile}
%
%You will need to personalise the thesis template and make it your own by filling in your own information. This is done by editing the `\texttt{Thesis.cls}' file in a text editor.
%
%Open the file and scroll down, past all the `$\backslash$\texttt{newcommand}\ldots' items until you see the entries for `\texttt{University Name}', `\texttt{Department Name}', etc\ldots.
%
%Fill out the information about your group and institution and ensure you keep to block capitals where it asks you to. You can also insert web links, if you do, make sure you use the full URL, including the `\texttt{http://}' for this.
%
%The last item you should need to fill in is the Faculty Name (in block capitals). When you have done this, save the file and recompile `\texttt{Thesis.tex}'. All the information you filled in should now be in the PDF, complete with web links. You can now begin your thesis proper!
%
%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%\section{The `\texttt{Thesis.tex}' File Explained}
%
%The \texttt{Thesis.tex} file contains the structure of the thesis. There are plenty of written comments that explain what pages, sections and formatting the \LaTeX{} code is creating. Initially there seems to be a lot of \LaTeX{} code, but this is all formatting, and it has all been taken care of so you don't have to do it.
%
%Begin by checking that your information on the title page is correct. For the thesis declaration, your institution may insist on something different than the text given. If this is the case, just replace what you see with what is required.
%
%Then comes a page which contains a funny quote. You can put your own, or quote your favourite scientist, author, person, etc\ldots Make sure to put the name of the person who you took the quote from.
%
%Next comes the acknowledgements. On this page, write about all the people who you wish to thank (not forgetting parents, partners and your advisor/supervisor).
%
%The contents pages, list of figures and tables are all taken care of for you and do not need to be manually created or edited. The next set of pages are optional and can be deleted since they are for a more technical thesis: insert a list of abbreviations you have used in the thesis, then a list of the physical constants and numbers you refer to and finally, a list of mathematical symbols used in any formulae. Making the effort to fill these tables means the reader has a one-stop place to refer to instead of searching the internet and references to try and find out what you meant by certain abbreviations or symbols.
%
%The list of symbols is split into the Roman and Greek alphabets. Whereas the abbreviations and symbols ought to be listed in alphabetical order (and this is \emph{not} done automatically for you) the list of physical constants should be grouped into similar themes.
%
%The next page contains a one line dedication. Who will you dedicate your thesis to?
%
%Finally, there is the section where the chapters are included. Uncomment the lines (delete the `\texttt{\%}' character) as you write the chapters. Each chapter should be written in its own file and put into the `Chapters' folder and named `\texttt{Chapter1}', `\texttt{Chapter2}, etc\ldots Similarly for the appendices, uncomment the lines as you need them. Each appendix should go into its own file and placed in the `Appendices' folder.
%
%After the preamble, chapters and appendices finally comes the bibliography. The bibliography style (called `\texttt{unsrtnat}') is used for the bibliography and is a fully featured style that will even include links to where the referenced paper can be found online. Do not under estimate how grateful you reader will be to find that a reference to a paper is just a click away. Of course, this relies on you putting the URL information into the BibTeX file in the first place.
%
%%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
%\section{Thesis Features and Conventions}\label{ThesisConventions}
%
%To get the best out of this template, there are a few conventions that you may want to follow.
%
%One of the most important (and most difficult) things to keep track of in such a long document as a thesis is consistency. Using certain conventions and ways of doing things (such as using a Todo list) makes the job easier. Of course, all of these are optional and you can adopt your own method.
%
%\subsection{Printing Format}
%
%This thesis template is designed for single sided printing as most theses are printed and bound this way. This means that the left margin is always wider than the right (for binding). Four out of five people will now judge the margins by eye and think, ``I never 
%noticed that before.''.
%
%The headers for the pages contain the page number on the right side (so it is easy to flick through to the page you want) and the chapter name on the left side.
%
%The text is set to 11 point and a line spacing of 1.3. Generally, it is much more readable to have a smaller text size and wider gap between the lines than it is to have a larger text size and smaller gap. Again, you can tune the text size and spacing should you want or need to. The text size can be set in the options for the `$\backslash$\texttt{documentclass}' command at the top of the `\texttt{Thesis.tex}' file and the spacing can be changed by setting a different value in the `$\backslash$\texttt{setstretch}' commands (scattered throughout the `\texttt{Thesis.tex}' file).
%
%\subsection{Using US Letter Paper}
%
%The paper size used in the template is A4, which is a common -- if not standard -- size in Europe. If you are using this thesis template elsewhere and particularly in the United States, then you may have to change the A4 paper size to the US Letter size. Unfortunately, this is not as simple as replacing instances of `\texttt{a4paper}' with `\texttt{letterpaper}'.
%
%This is because the final PDF file is created directly from the \LaTeX{} source using a program called `\texttt{pdfTeX}' and in certain conditions, paper size commands are ignored and all documents are created with the paper size set to the size stated in the configuration file for pdfTeX (called `\texttt{pdftex.cfg}').
%
%What needs to be done is to change the paper size in the configuration file for \texttt{pdfTeX} to reflect the letter size. There is an excellent tutorial on how to do this here: \\
%\href{http://www.physics.wm.edu/~norman/latexhints/pdf_papersize.html}{\texttt{http://www.physics.wm.edu/$\sim$norman/latexhints/pdf\_papersize.html}}
%
%It may be sufficient just to replace the dimensions of the A4 paper size with the US Letter size in the \texttt{pdftex.cfg} file. Due to the differences in the paper size, the resulting margins may be different to what you like or require (as it is common for Institutions to dictate certain margin sizes). If this is the case, then the margin sizes can be tweaked by opening up the \texttt{Thesis.cls} file and searching for the line beginning with, `$\backslash$\texttt{setmarginsrb}' (not very far down from the top), there you will see the margins specified. Simply change those values to what you need (or what looks good) and save. Now your document should be set up for US Letter paper size with suitable margins.
%
%%\subsection{References}
%
%The `\texttt{natbib}' package is used to format the bibliography and inserts references such as this one \citep{Reference3}. The options used in the `\texttt{Thesis.tex}' file mean that the references are listed in numerical order as they appear in the text. Multiple references are rearranged in numerical order (e.g. \citep{Reference2, Reference1}) and multiple, sequential references become reformatted to a reference range (e.g. \citep{Reference2, Reference1, Reference3}). This is done automatically for you. To see how you use references, have a look at the `\texttt{Chapter1.tex}' source file. Many reference managers allow you to simply drag the reference into the document as you type.
%
%Scientific references should come \emph{before} the punctuation mark if there is one (such as a comma or period). The same goes for footnotes\footnote{Such as this footnote, here down at the bottom of the page.}. You can change this but the most important thing is to keep the convention consistent throughout the thesis. Footnotes themselves should be full, descriptive sentences (beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full stop).
%
%To see how \LaTeX{} typesets the bibliography, have a look at the very end of this document (or just click on the reference number links).
%
%\subsection{Figures}
%
%There will hopefully be many figures in your thesis (that should be placed in the `Figures' folder). The way to insert figures into your thesis is to use a code template like this:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%  \centering
%    \includegraphics{Figures/Electron.pdf}
%    \rule{35em}{0.5pt}
%  \caption[An Electron]{An electron (artist's impression).}
%  
%\end{figure}
%\end{verbatim}
%Also look in the source file. Putting this code into the source file produces the picture of the electron that you can see in the figure below.
%
%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%	\centering
%		%\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{Electron.pdf}

%
%Sometimes figures don't always appear where you write them in the source. The placement depends on how much space there is on the page for the figure. Sometimes there is not enough room to fit a figure directly where it should go (in relation to the text) and so \LaTeX{} puts it at the top of the next page. Positioning figures is the job of \LaTeX{} and so you should only worry about making them look good!
%
%Figures usually should have labels just in case you need to refer to them (such as in Figure \ref{fig:Electron}). The `$\backslash$\texttt{caption}' command contains two parts, the first part, inside the square brackets is the title that will appear in the `List of Figures', and so should be short. The second part in the curly brackets should contain the longer and more descriptive caption text.
%
%The `$\backslash$\texttt{rule}' command is optional and simply puts an aesthetic horizontal line below the image. If you do this for one image, do it for all of them.
%
%The \LaTeX{} Thesis Template is able to use figures that are either in the PDF or JPEG file format.
%
%\subsection{Typesetting mathematics}
%
%If your thesis is going to contain heavy mathematical content, be sure that \LaTeX{} will make it look beautiful, even though it won't be able to solve the equations for you.
%
%The ``Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX{}'' (available \href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}{here}) should tell you everything you need to know for most cases of typesetting mathematics. If you need more information, a much more thorough mathematical guide is available from the AMS called, ``A Short Math Guide to \LaTeX{}'' and can be downloaded from:\\
%\href{ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf}{\texttt{ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf}}
%
%There are many different \LaTeX{} symbols to remember, luckily you can find the most common symbols \href{http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/latexsymbols.html}{here}. You can use the web page as a quick reference or crib sheet and because the symbols are grouped and rendered as high quality images (each with a downloadable PDF), finding the symbol you need is quick and easy.
%
%You can write an equation, which is automatically given an equation number by \LaTeX{} like this:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{equation}
%E = mc^{2}
%  \label{eqn:Einstein}
%\end{equation}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%This will produce Einstein's famous energy-matter equivalence equation:
%\begin{equation}
%E = mc^{2}
%\label{eqn:Einstein}
%\end{equation}
%
%All equations you write (which are not in the middle of paragraph text) are automatically given equation numbers by \LaTeX{}. If you don't want a particular equation numbered, just put the command, `$\backslash$\texttt{nonumber}' immediately after the equation.

%
%\section{Sectioning and Subsectioning}
%
%You should break your thesis up into nice, bite-sized sections and subsections. \LaTeX{} automatically builds a table of Contents by looking at all the `$\backslash$\texttt{chapter}$\{\}$', `$\backslash$\texttt{section}$\{\}$' and `$\backslash$\texttt{subsection}$\{\}$' commands you write in the source.
%
%The table of Contents should only list the sections to three (3) levels. A `$\backslash$\texttt{chapter}$\{\}$' is level one (1). A `$\backslash$\texttt{section}$\{\}$' is level two (2) and so a `$\backslash$\texttt{subsection}$\{\}$' is level three (3). In your thesis it is likely that you will even use a `$\backslash$\texttt{subsubsection}$\{\}$', which is level four (4). Adding all these will create an unnecessarily cluttered table of Contents and so you should use the `$\backslash$\texttt{subsubsection$^{*}\{\}$}' command instead (note the asterisk). The asterisk ($^{*}$) tells \LaTeX{} to omit listing the subsubsection in the Contents, keeping it clean and tidy.

%\section{In Closing}
%
%You have reached the end of this mini-guide. You can now rename or overwrite this pdf file and begin writing your own `\texttt{Chapter1.tex}' and the rest of your thesis. The easy work of setting up the structure and framework has been taken care of for you. It's now your job to fill it out!
%
%Good luck and have lots of fun!
